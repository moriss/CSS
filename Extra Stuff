This can also be used for error notes.

Non flexbox note:
If you set a float-right property in a text div then add a width rule of 10% etc, the text seems to fall to the next line when you drag the screen size smaller. Ommiting the width property seems to keep the text on the same line. 

Clearing floats:
footer {clear:both}
This stops ie float left where you want it to stop. 

display:inline-block >Do this one next.See web page on phone
