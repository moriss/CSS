This repo name CSS was locally cloned at blueDesktop. The name of the file is CSS. This is where you will edit and push updates to github.

23.01.24
As a brief update on how you intend moving forward:
You have created a "style_story" file that is your journey through learning styling and related. "style_story" will prove to be a great resource especially when you have been away from it for a while. As you work through it, things can be condensed and moved to other relevant files for more specific referencing.

So your first port of call is "style_story" STOPPED HERE.




 



DEAL WITH BELOW AFTER RESOLVING GITHUB ISSUES AND PRACTICES.
You have two main folders on blue/desktop
CSS FLEX:  For practice (including learning flex).
and
and git_css: Contains the files needing updated on your github css.

This is a starting point for all the flexbox stuff required.
PRACTICE HERE: 
blue Desktop/CSS_FLEX/site_1 > index2.html  You are currently working on the BBC saved site.
Bare in mind you may also be using non flexbox styling.
You are also practicing inspecting elements on a live site so you can see what's going on. (See chatgpt)
When you come across new stuff, issues and errors (including non flex stuff) you are adding them to blue/Desktop/git_css >Extra Stuff.
This needs to update your online git_css New Stuff file.


You also have a css_guide you created when reading the selectors and specifity book. It is located at (blue/desktop/git_css)






Decide each time you do something if you want to put it into the quick samples folder with a pertinent filename. 
blue Desktop/CSS_FLEX/quick samples. Although don't worry too much about this.
