# CSS
Given that flexbox plays a major roll in css nowadays, It's important that you familiarise yourself with it and use it more frequently.
I also think its important to try building pages with traditional block and inline elements etc (the old way of doing things) to get a better perspective and to be able to offer an alternative to flexbox, for whatever reason. 
I'm not talking about big website design. I just mean trying out alternatives for simple pages.

Your go-to files are:
flexbox_intro  for further guidence 
Organic : for following a logical sequence of typical things you would like to be able to achieve using flexbox
flexbox_snipets:  A short list of code you've used and understood, with explanations (for quick reerence)

All three files are used interchangeably
