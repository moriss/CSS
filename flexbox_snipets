contents:  display:flex with wrap,  Justify content,  align items  


display:flex; 
flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse;
Shorthand:
display:flex; flex-flow: column wrap; |or| row wrap; /**display:flex is required here**/
flex-wrap:wrap; /**Defaults to row and [obviously] wraps**/


'Justify content' refers to arranging items along the main axis, ie from left to right as you would write.
flex start | flex end | center | space between | space around | space evenly | flex start
Paired with 'safe' avoids 'data loss' (elements you can't scroll to)
unsafe : I don't know why you would pair a value with 'unsafe'?


Align Items: How child elements 'hang' within the div. NB:For single line flexible containers.
align-items: stretch | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | first baseline | last baseline | start | end | self-start | self-end + ... safe | unsafe;


align-content   (for multi-line flexible containers). 
align-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly | stretch | start | end | baseline | first baseline | last baseline + ... safe | unsafe
