Choose row or column and wrapped or not wrapped (within container)Not wrapped causes row items to flow outside the container and stay on one line.
Wrap doesn't seem to be required with a column layout?
wrap options:
flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse;
{display:flex; flex-wrap:wrap;}/**Defaults to row and [obviously] wraps**/
Shorthand for above:
display:flex; flex-flow: column wrap; |or| row wrap; /**This does not work for me without display:flex; (at the start)**/
Also
left :packed toward left edge of the container, unless that doesn’t make sense with the flex-direction, then it behaves like start
right: packed toward right edge of the container, unless that doesn’t make sense with the flex-direction, then it behaves like end


Lets see options for arranging the items in a container.
'Justify content' refers to arranging items along the main axis, ie from left to right as you would write.
flex start[packed toward the start of the flex-direction.] | 
flex end [packed toward the end of the flex-direction.] | 
center[items are centered along the line]
space between[pushes to the edges] 
space around[slightly different to space evenly[]
space evenly
flex start seems to be the default.

"There are also two additional keywords you can pair with these values: safe and unsafe. Using safe ensures that however you do this type of positioning, you can’t push an element such that it renders off-screen (e.g. off the top) in such a way the content can’t be scrolled too (called “data loss”)."
